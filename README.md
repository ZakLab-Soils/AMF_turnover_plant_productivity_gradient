Code repositories for manuscripts related to sampling in 2022 from the Manistee National Forest across a natural nitrogen mineralization gradient. 

## Background
Composite soil cores (5 cm x 5cm) were collected around *Quercus rubra* (red oak; n=60) trees and *Acer rubrum*/*A. saccharum* (red/sugar maple; n=72) trees across 12 stands (ref).

</p>


Stands are even-aged (~100 year old) across a ~50km landscape with similar bulk soil properties but with microsite differences in nutrient and water characteristics that have created a gradient in soil inorganic N availability that has naturally been maintained (Argiroff et al, 2022, Pellitier et al, 2021, Zak et al, 1986). In 2022 we resampled for environmental variables (soi pH, N mineralization, etc) alongside tree characteristics and growth. Oak trees were previously used for analysis (Pellitier et al, 2021), but maple trees were newly added for the 2022 sampling.
