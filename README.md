# Repositories for manuscripts for 2022 Manistee National Forest nitrogen mineralization gradient

Code repositories for manuscripts related to sampling in 2022 from the Manistee National Forest across a natural nitrogen mineralization gradient. Composite soil cores (5 cm x 5cm) were collected around 60 red oak trees and 72 maple (sugar and red) trees across 12 stands (ref).

Soil characteristics were previously described (refs), but each tree was resampled for environmental variables (soil pH, inorganic N availability, etc). 

Each tree was assessed for DBH measurements at time of sampling. Also, tree cores were taken and analzyed to measure BAI (ref).
