Sequences for this manuscript are deposited in the NCBI SRA database under the Manistee Forest Soil Nitrogen Mineralization Gradient Study BioProject (PRJNA714922) with the SRA accession numbers SRR27482494-SRR27482565. This includes the raw reads for the forward and reverse sequences from a MiSeq 2 x 250bp run using modified versions of the NS31 and AML2 primers to target arbuscular mycorrhizal 18S rDNA.

The R scripts used for analyzing the sequences are included in the code folder. The data folder contains the soil environmental data and metadata for each sample/tree used in this study. The database folder has the edited Maarjam (reference) used for taxonomic assignments as well as the fasta file used for phylogenetic trees construction.
